# Description

Given: A list of 2D (all different) points: (x_1, y_1), ..., (x_K, y_K); numbers use floating point representation.

As known from basic geometry, one can draw a straight line between any two such points. The goal is to find all lines that have more than two points on them from the input set.

You can choose any way to represent a line, but the common one is y = m \* x + b.

For example, if the input is (0, 0), (1,1), (3,5), (2,2), the output should be

(m=1, b=0) because this line has three points from the input set: (0, 0), (1,1), (2,2).
